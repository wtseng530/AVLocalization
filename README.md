This codebase was developed as part of research that led to the publication of a paper titled 
"CroCo: Cross-Modal Contrastive learning for localization of Earth Observation data". 
While the code is no longer actively supported, the results derived from it have been documented in the following publication:

### Abstract: 

It is of interest to localize a ground-based LiDAR point cloud on remote sensing imagery. In this work, we tackle a subtask of this
problem, i.e. to map a digital elevation model (DEM) rasterized from aerial LiDAR point cloud on the aerial imagery. We proposed
a contrastive learning-based method that trains on DEM and high-resolution optical imagery and experiment the framework on
different data sampling strategies and hyperparameters. In the best scenario, the Top-1 score of 0.71 and Top-5 score of 0.81 are
obtained. The proposed method is promising for feature learning from RGB and DEM for localization and is potentially applicable
to other data sources too
